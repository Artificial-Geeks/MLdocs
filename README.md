Hey everyone, I'm Bhuvnesh

nice to meet you all!

What you're looking at is a simple yet powerful project for documenting machine learning topics and concepts. It started as a way to save ML practicals and notes, but has grown into much more.

This project is completely open source, so feel free to contribute!

See you around!

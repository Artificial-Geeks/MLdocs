| Lab Number | Aim                          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Data Preprocessing           | Prepare Titanic dataset: EDA, handle missing values/outliers, encoding, scaling, and train-test split.        |
| 2          | Car Price Prediction         | Build regression models to predict used car prices; perform EDA, outlier handling, evaluation, and tuning.    |
| 3          | Find-S Algorithm             | Apply Find-S to determine maximally specific hypothesis and test with sample instances.                       |
| 4          | Customer Purchase Prediction | Use Decision Tree to predict buying intent; evaluate with Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy; save model.        |
| 5          | KNN Algorithm                | Implement KNN for classification and regression; calculate distances, select neighbors, and predict outcomes. |
| 6          | Backpropagation              | Train a neural network on XOR using backpropagation and sigmoid activation.                                   |

Hello, Iâ€™m **Bhuvnesh Verma**.

What youâ€™re exploring right now is a simple yet efficient documentation of **Machine Learning**. Along with explanations, it also includes hands-on **labs** designed to help you understand concepts in a practical way.

At the end of each lab, youâ€™ll find an attached **Colab notebook** containing all the code, so you can run and experiment directly. You can also copy snippets from the documentation itself.

This is an **open-source project**, so feel free to contribute and make it even better!

Currently, the documentation is divided into two main sections:

- **Topics**
- **Labs**

In the near future, weâ€™ll also introduce a **Guide** section â€” a step-by-step pathway for learning Machine Learning from scratch.

Stay tuned, stay updated, and happy learning!

Thanks ðŸ™Œ
